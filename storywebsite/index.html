        <h1>A Letter To You</h1>
        <p>And it's done.</p>
        
        <p>So… 10th ends too. A lot of memories and experiences have happened since. Must be wondering why I went through all this effort just to get you this letter? Well, I have a couple of confessions to make—to exit without any burden...</p>
        
        <p><strong>I know girls have that instinct to sense things. You must’ve sensed it too—I’ve had a big crush on you.</strong></p>
        
        <p>If I think back now, I probably gave a lot of hints unintentionally. But what’s special about this? Nothing much, except… this crush has lasted for about 9-10 years now. Yeah, you were my childhood crush for real. xD</p>
        
        <p>I think I just liked talking to you. Somehow, it always made me feel good. You might not have noticed, but I’ve always been a pretty lonely person...</p>
        
        <p>The people I call friends… they’re just casual ones. I keep 90% of “me” hidden from them. Not because I want to, but because I’ve never found the right people to truly talk to.</p>
        
        <p>Until the age of 11-12, things were going fine. But when I turned 13, something changed. Overthinking came in. My thoughts shifted. I started keeping to myself more and more. Nobody knows that I spend my time studying philosophy, history, Vedas, Upanishads, Tantra, as well as quantum mechanics, physics, biotechnology, nanobots, and now even AI. I do hundreds of things that no one around me knows about. Maybe it’s a fear of judgment. Or maybe I just don’t think I’m surrounded by the right kind of people who would understand.</p>
        
        <p>At 14, I convinced myself I was a "lone wolf," thinking I didn’t need anyone. Being alone felt like a superpower. I got addicted to it. But now, I realize I’ve stayed in that grey zone for too long. And the white zone? Still far away.</p>
        
        <p>You might be wondering—where do you come into this?</p>
        
        <p>Well, when you’re this isolated, even while surrounded by people, that one presence—that one person who makes you feel good—matters even more. A crush like that? It only gets stronger. And it never really fades until you force yourself to be more social.</p>
        
        <p>You remember that MUN debate? Of course, you do. I didn’t want to be that quiet, silent introverted guy. I wanted to speak, to talk, to make the experience better for you and everyone around. But… I don’t know what happened. I just couldn’t. It was like I slipped back into my past habits for a moment. Still, I loved MUN. And I plan to join more in the future—because I’ve figured out how to win in them.</p>
        
        <p>But sometimes, it’s not even my fault that I’m this introverted. At school, with all the fake people, I forget my loneliness and just go with the flow. But if you’ve ever noticed me, on days when most people are absent, I just sit there—living dead, staring at the door the teacher keeps closed.</p>
        
        <p>That’s why now, I’m trying to become as social as possible. Because it’s the only way forward. Might not seem relatable to you, but trust me—it’s a huge challenge for a lot of people.</p>
        
        <p>And as for that “topper” tag? I hate it. Never wanted to be a topper. I just want to explore things as deeply as I can. It pisses me off when people limit me to just a rank. Though, recently, my grades have dropped enough to prove I’m no topper anyway.</p>
        
        <p>Here’s another thing that no one knows about me, except Lakshay, that I write. I write poetries, articles, my own theories around science, history, and things like that, and am also writing a non-fiction book. I also tried writing fiction, but discarded it, thinking of a new idea. Wrote some poetries on you too as well, I think it's the best time to share them now.</p>


      <h2>Un.Dec</h2>
      <p>10 years ago, at a summer camp.<br>
I remember it clear, when they took my hand.<br>
The warmth of those red hands, in little young me.<br>
When collided with theirs, made my heart skip a beat.<br>

<p>No denial that history repeated many times since,<br>
Sometimes built my heart, but also breaking into smithereens.</p>

<p>A decade of time, has gone now behind.<br>
Yet history repeated again, again another time.<br>
Summer camp replaced to school.<br>
September, got replaced from June.</p>

<p>The sunlight on their face, when they smiled at me,<br>
We walking together, together and free.<br>
Wished that time would never had an end.<br>
But everyone has to surrend, sure as me, sure as them.</p>

      <p>(Well, this is the time I remember, during that summer camp, where we had to tick on the events we wanted to participate in, and I, like dumbos, didn't know anything about it. I entered the summer camp of our school, and just didn’t know anything. So, my sister left me with you, and I just went to the same events as you did. Not sure, if you’d remember this. Do you? And the second one is when we were anchoring. It was fun thb. Because trust me, my next partner was just so bad. I hated her. And I actually thought of asking you, if you wanted to participate again, but thought your reply would be known and I might sound dumb. So I didn’t. Well, I learned something from it. For sure.)</p>

<p>I actually have many poems. But I think this one is enough. But yea, telling ya, I don’t only write about crushes lol. Infact, I like writing more on nature and life.</p>

      <p>Before ending, I would like to say, if you just have a tiny space for me, please let’s keep this up to both of us only. I know it might sound unfair, but please do not share this with anyone. If only I have made you laugh once, or might have mistakenly been useful to you, just please don’t share it with anyone…
I’d definitely say, you were always very kind. It was just me who always behaved immaturely. Never let that kindness die in yourself. I hope you live a good life further. Because I think we might never cross paths again, as I'm changing my school (ofc, who would study in that shithole now). Well, even if we crossed paths again.. I might already evaporate out of embarrassment lol. But yea, this was necessary, writing this was definitely necessary. Now my only task is to make it reach you. I think if you’re reading this, I might have done well.</p>
      
        <h2>Last Poem</h2>
        <p>Been long since the start.<br>
        I've come to an end, finally.<br>
        This restlessness beats through my heart.<br>
        Shows my hollow efforts I've done so far.</p>
        
        <p>I'll only be a moment for you,<br>
        But it has been a timeless journey for me.<br>
        Although I have memories few,<br>
        Because I know you might not come back as dew.</p>
        
        <p>Hope I was as transparent as glass.<br>
        So that you could have seen through me.<br>
        But now you can see,<br>
        I'm at least fragile. Alas.</p>
        
        <p>Those memories are imprinted in me.<br>
        So as this one will too.<br>
        This burden to shed off is too high now,<br>
        That now I don’t expect an acception from you.</p>
        
        <p>Choice was always yours.<br>
        Will always be yours.<br>
        If you ever thought of it,<br>
        You'll always find me at your doors.</p>

        
        
        <p class="signature">- Yours truly</p>
